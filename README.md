# Adaptive-Inventory-System
Friday - The Adaptive Inventory System

The adaptive inventory system project was taken up given the fact that the generation gap that exists in our country which causes most of the senior citizens as well as the upper range of adult population who own small scale businesses to prefer traditional methods of tracking their inventory rather then hiring professionals or are themselves restricted due to lack of technical knowledge. Given these all factors this project was worked on and built for the benefit of the society and to reduce the technical knowledge gap that exists. This project was not made to compete with the existing inventory systems in the market rather the main focus was to increase the easy of access and make it more convenient to use especially those who lack technical skills and knowledge.


The main parts of the project were:

• Create your own profile for one or multiple businesses.

• Create the type of Inventory best suited for your business.

• To add new categories of businesses and their details to the system.

• To update details/quantity/type of the data.

• To delete details/quantity/type of the data.

• To view the details/quantity/type of the data.

• Admin login for activating/deactivating the profiles.


Goals of the project:

• Make it easier for people with lack of technical skills/knowledge to make use of the inventory system.

• Increase the ease of access of such systems.

• Provide a generic system for all kinds of systems.

• Help people shift and transition to this inventory system rather than using traditional methods of inventory tracking.


Future Scope:

• Incorporate a payment method for ordering of the required stock.

• Proper billing system which prints the bill along with the logo of the respective business can also be added to the system.

• Add features which can turn this system into a full large-scale business system with all the complexities and required necessities.

• Host the project on the web and also implementing better security features which can prevent hacking.
